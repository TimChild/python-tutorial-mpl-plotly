Here we will look at the most popular and a common starting place, Numpy. (Pandas builds on top of Numpy and they work together very well).\n","\n","The Numpy package provides many of the same functions as found in Matlab, plus many many more. \n","\n","To use Numpy, the numpy package must first be imported into the script using an import statement. It is common to import numpy like this: `import numpy as np`. The as `np` part just makes it quicker to type when using later. As with all import statements, they need only be run once, but it doesn't hurt to run them multiple times.\n","\n","e.g.\n","```\n","import numpy as np\n","xdata = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8])\n","```\n","To create a numpy array from scratch. Or\n","```\n","xdata = np.linspace(0, 100, 1000)  # Creates a 1D array with 1000 values from 0 -> 100\n","ydata = np.sin(xdata)  # Creates a 1D array with sin(x) evaluated at each xdata value\n","```\n","\n","The Numpy package has extremely good documentation which can be found [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html). \n","\n","Additionally, any question you might have that doesn't have an obvious answer in the documentation has 99.9% of the time, been asked on StackOverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/) already, and the answers are usually extremely helpful.
